        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p><i>Dig Dug</i> is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth.
            <br>Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you
            around.
            <br> The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point
            where they explode. [...]

        <blockquote> definitely goes under the heading of "Games That Were Made While a Programmer Was on Drugs," or at
            least had a good imagination. And maybe they were into horror movies too.
